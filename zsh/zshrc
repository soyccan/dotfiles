# The inner expansion follows ${name:-word} form, so as the variable called
# `name` (which is empty string) does not exist, the value will be given from
# `word` (which is "%x"). Refer to:
# http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Doc/Release/Expansion.html#Parameter-Expansion
#
# The %x is a prompt escape indicating the file being sourced. Refer to:
# http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Doc/Release/Prompt-Expansion.html#Shell-state
#
# And the (%) is a parameter expansion flag that expands the %x. Refer to:
# http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Doc/Release/Expansion.html#Parameter-Expansion-Flags
#
# The outer expansion has P modifier that calls realpath() to obtain the
# absolute path, and h modifier to obtain dirname. Refer to:
# http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Doc/Release/Expansion.html#Modifiers
